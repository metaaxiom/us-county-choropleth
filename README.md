# US County Choropleth

An interactive, movable and zoomable map of all United States counties, each of which can be selected and assigned into color-coded groups that list the population of each county as well as of the total region. The app was built for a client doing statistical research.

## Tech Stack

The map of US counties and its basic interactivity - panning, zooming, and county selection - was built using the D3 JavaScript library. The user interface surrounding the map - such as the sidebar displaying the statistics or the save and load modals - were made with the help of Vue.js.
